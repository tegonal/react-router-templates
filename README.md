# Tegonal React Router Starters

This project contains various React Router starters, each tailored for different use cases. The goal is to provide a solid foundation for building applications with React Router, showcasing best practices and efficient patterns.

All starters are designed to be easily extensible and customizable, allowing developers to adapt them to their specific needs. The starters are built with TypeScript and utilize the latest features of React Router.

## Available Starters
- **ssr-daisyui**: A starter template for server-side rendering (SSR) with DaisyUI components.

## Getting Started

```

Then, follow the instructions of `create-react-router` to set up your project.

To get the project up and running, navigate to the project directory that was just created and run:

```bash
yarn install # to install all dependencies
yarn up # to update the dependencies
